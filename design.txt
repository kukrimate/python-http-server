I ended up implementing a standard-ish HTTP/1.0 server/client with one method
PUT pulled in from HTTP/1.1 to allow for one of the required commands.
Directory listings are implemented by GET-ing /.

Please note that this program mainly targets Unix-like operating systems with
fork. There is a basic workaround implemented to allow Windows to work, but it
kills performance as everything becomes single-threaded.
